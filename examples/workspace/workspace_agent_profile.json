    "score": "3",

    "label": "Consultant",
    "reasoning": "The agent is designed to take an initial task from the user and then autonomously decompose it, plan the execution, and manage communications and scheduling. It is expected to be 'proactive in identifying conflicts and suggesting solutions', which fits the 'Consultant' role where the agent leads the task but may consult the user for guidance or to resolve issues. It's more than a collaborator as it does the planning independently, but it's not an approver as it's not described as having hard gates for user approval."

  "efficacy": {
    "score": "3",
    "level": "E.3",
    "label": "Intermediate / Mediated",
    "reasoning": "The agent has tools to send and delete emails, and create calendar events. Although the current implementation uses mock data, the documentation explicitly states that in a production environment, it would integrate with real email and calendar APIs (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook). This gives the agent the ability to directly change digital states, which corresponds to the 'Intermediate / Mediated' efficacy level."

  "goal_complexity": {
    "score": "3",
    "level": "GC.3",
    "label": "Adaptive",
    "reasoning": "The agent's instructions state that it must 'decompose and plan how to achieve that goal autonomously'. Tasks like 'Coordinating meeting scheduling through email threads' require breaking down a high-level goal into smaller sub-goals (e.g., check availability, send invitations, process responses, book the meeting). The agent also needs to be 'proactive in identifying conflicts and suggesting solutions', which implies it can adapt its plan in response to new information or failures. This aligns with the 'Adaptive' level of goal complexity."

  "generality": {
    "score": "2",
    "level": "G.2",
    "label": "Domain Specific",
    "reasoning": "The agent's capabilities are focused on email and calendar management. This represents a bundle of related tasks within the single domain of 'personal productivity' or 'office assistance'. The agent is not designed to operate across multiple, distinct domains (like finance, healthcare, and creative writing), so it fits the 'Domain Specific' level of generality."
